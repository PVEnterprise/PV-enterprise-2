## 🔄 What Changed

### Before
- **Sales Rep** could create and read customers
- This allowed sales reps to add new customers to the system

### After
- **Sales Rep** can only read customers (view-only)
- **Only Executive** can create, update, or delete customers
- This centralizes customer data management with admin oversight

## 🎯 Why This Change?

1. **Data Quality Control**: Ensures customer data is properly validated and maintained by authorized personnel
2. **Centralized Management**: Admin has full control over customer database
3. **Prevent Duplicates**: Reduces risk of duplicate customer entries
4. **Audit Trail**: All customer changes tracked to admin users
5. **Business Logic**: Sales reps can view customers to create orders, but can't modify master data

## 🧪 Testing the Changes

### Test as Sales Rep
1. Login as: `sales@medicalequipment.com` / `sales123`
2. Go to Customers page
3. ✅ Should see list of customers
4. ❌ Should NOT see "Add Customer" button
5. ❌ Should NOT see "Edit" buttons on customer cards

### Test as Executive
1. Login as: `admin@medicalequipment.com` / `admin123`
2. Go to Customers page
3. ✅ Should see list of customers
4. ✅ Should see "Add Customer" button
5. ✅ Should see "Edit" and "Delete" buttons

## 💻 Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
**File**: `backend/app/core/permissions.py`
- Removed `Permission.CUSTOMER_CREATE` from `Role.SALES_REP`
- Updated permissions mapping

### Database Update
**Script**: `backend/scripts/update_permissions.py`
- Created script to update existing role permissions
- Ran successfully to update all roles in database

### Frontend Impact
The frontend will automatically respect these permissions:
- UI elements (buttons, forms) should be conditionally rendered
- API calls will be rejected if user lacks permission
- Navigation and routes already filter by permissions

## 🔒 Security Enforcement

### Backend (Already Implemented)
```python
# In customers endpoint
@router.post("/", response_model=CustomerResponse)
def create_customer(
    customer: CustomerCreate,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(PermissionChecker(Permission.CUSTOMER_CREATE))
):
    # Only users with CUSTOMER_CREATE permission can access
    ...
```

### Frontend (To Be Implemented)
```tsx
// In CustomersPage.tsx
{user?.role?.permissions?.['customer:create'] && (
  <button>Add Customer</button>
)}
```

## 📝 Next Steps

### Frontend Updates Needed
1. **CustomersPage.tsx**: Hide "Add Customer" button for non-admin users
2. **Customer Forms**: Disable edit/delete actions for non-admin users
3. **UI Feedback**: Show read-only indicators for non-admin users

### Recommended Frontend Changes
```tsx
// Example: Conditional rendering in CustomersPage
const canManageCustomers = user?.role?.permissions?.['customer:create'] === true;

return (
  <div>
    {canManageCustomers && (
      <button onClick={handleAddCustomer}>
        Add Customer
      </button>
    )}
    {/* Customer list with conditional edit/delete buttons */}
  </div>
);
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] Permissions updated in `permissions.py`
- [x] Database roles updated with new permissions
- [x] Sales Rep no longer has `customer:create`
- [x] Only Executive has full customer CRUD
- [x] All other roles have read-only access
- [ ] Frontend UI updated to hide create/edit buttons (recommended)
- [ ] Testing completed with all roles

## 🔄 How to Revert (If Needed)

If you need to give Sales Rep customer creation rights back:

1. Edit `backend/app/core/permissions.py`:
```python
Role.SALES_REP: {
    Permission.ORDER_CREATE,
    Permission.ORDER_READ,
    Permission.CUSTOMER_CREATE,  # Add this back
    Permission.CUSTOMER_READ,
    Permission.DASHBOARD_VIEW,
},
```

2. Run update script:
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/update_permissions.py
```

## 📞 Support

The permission system is now properly configured. Users need to **logout and login again** for the new permissions to take effect in their session.

**Current Status**: ✅ **Customer permissions successfully restricted to Admin only**
