# Order Creation & Processing Workflow

## üîÑ Complete Order Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Order Creation (Sales Rep)

**Who:** Sales Representative  
**Permission:** `order:create`

**What They Do:**
1. Click "New Order"
2. Select customer (autocomplete search)
3. Describe requirements in plain text:
   ```
   Example:
   - 100 boxes of surgical gloves (size M)
   - 2 units of X-ray machines (Model XR-500)
   - 50 pieces of N95 surgical masks
   - 10 sets of surgical instrument kits
   ```
4. Set priority (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
5. Add any additional notes
6. Submit

**Result:**
- Order created with status: `draft`
- Workflow stage: `order_entry`
- Single placeholder item with full requirements description
- Assigned to decoder for processing

**Key Point:** Sales doesn't need to know SKUs, quantities, or inventory details. They just describe what the customer needs in words.

---

### Phase 2: Order Decoding (Decoder)

**Who:** Decoder  
**Permission:** `order:update` (decoding)

**What They Do:**
1. View orders in "Pending Decoding" status
2. Read the requirements description
3. Map each requirement to inventory items:
   - Find matching SKU in inventory
   - Set exact quantities
   - Set unit prices
   - Break down complex requirements into multiple items
4. Update each order item with:
   - `inventory_id` (link to inventory)
   - `quantity` (actual number needed)
   - `unit_price` (from inventory)
   - Status: `decoded`

**Example Transformation:**

**Before (from Sales):**
```
Requirements: "100 boxes of surgical gloves (size M), 2 X-ray machines"
Items: [
  {
    item_description: "100 boxes of surgical gloves (size M), 2 X-ray machines",
    quantity: 1,
    status: "pending_decode"
  }
]
```

**After (by Decoder):**
```
Items: [
  {
    item_description: "Surgical Gloves - Size M",
    inventory_id: "abc-123",
    quantity: 100,
    unit_price: 15.00,
    status: "decoded"
  },
  {
    item_description: "X-Ray Machine - Model XR-500",
    inventory_id: "xyz-789",
    quantity: 2,
    unit_price: 50000.00,
    status: "decoded"
  }
]
```

**Result:**
- Order status: `pending_approval`
- Workflow stage: `decoding_complete`
- All items mapped to inventory with quantities and prices
- Ready for executive approval

---

### Phase 3: Order Approval (Executive)

**Who:** Executive (Admin)  
**Permission:** `order:approve`

**What They Do:**
1. Review decoded orders
2. Check:
   - Customer details
   - All items properly mapped
   - Quantities and prices correct
   - Total order value
3. Approve or reject with comments

**Result if Approved:**
- Order status: `approved`
- Workflow stage: `approved`
- Ready for quotation generation

**Result if Rejected:**
- Order status: `draft`
- Workflow stage: Back to previous stage
- Comments explain what needs fixing

---

### Phase 4: Quotation Generation (Quoter)

**Who:** Quoter  
**Permission:** `quotation:create`

**What They Do:**
1. View approved orders
2. Generate quotation with:
   - All order items
   - Quantities and unit prices
   - Subtotal, taxes, total
   - Terms and conditions
   - Validity period
3. Send to customer

**Result:**
- Quotation created and linked to order
- Quotation status: `draft` or `sent`
- Awaiting customer acceptance

---

### Phase 5: Invoice & Fulfillment

**After customer accepts quotation:**

1. **Quoter** creates invoice
2. **Inventory Admin** prepares dispatch
3. **Inventory Admin** creates dispatch record
4. Order status: `completed`
